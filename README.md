# Zomato-Sales-Data-Analysis
Analyzed Zomato Sales data Using Power Bi
A demo Power Bi project on Zomato sales Analysis. 
In this demo project I have used demo datasets.
steps:
1. cleaned raw data and kept only the required data, then created some required calculated column's and also some required new measures.
2.Also maintained relationship's between the dataset.
3.then created visuals of three pages.
4.the first page is overview where i showed the allover sales of Zomato, here I have also gave options to categorize sales into veg, non-veg, the amount and quantity of sales and top 5 to top 50 cities ranks by sale.
5. the second page is the performance analysis page where I have shown the gain and lost customers over a period of time.
6.in the last page I have shown the sales by giving city wise analysis.
